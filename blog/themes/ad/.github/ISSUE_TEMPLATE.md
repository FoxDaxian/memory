#### Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_ or just a _question_?

<!-- 
If you have a question, please make sure you have read document and docs/常见问题.md carefully. 

You can also ask by sending email to yuanxin.me@gmail.com.

#### What's the current behavior?

<!-- 
For bugs, you **must** include the following: 

- The detailed information that clearly describes the issue.
- A GIF / Some screenshots showing the issue in action.
- Information about your OS, browser, etc.

If you don't include these, there's a very good chance your issue will be closed, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.

We need to keep the issues actionable, or else maintaining Art Design becomes overwhelming. Thank you for understanding!

#### What's the expected behavior?

<!-- 
The fastest, and most appreciated way to have your issue fixed is to create a pull request with working, tested code and we will help get it merged. 

Don't be scared to open a pull request that isn't completed and ask for input. We're happy to give direction! 

Also, researching how other editors handle this issue is super helpful.

I can't improve it without active contributors, so thank you so much for your help!
