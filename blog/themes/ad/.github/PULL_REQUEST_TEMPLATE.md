#### Is this adding or improving a _feature_ or fixing a _bug_?

<!-- 
If you have a question, open an issue instead:

https://github.com/dongyuanxin/theme-ad/issues
-->

#### Have you checked that...?

<!-- 
If you are not sure about the project architecture, code standards, or test processes, open an issue to disucuss instead:

https://github.com/dongyuanxin/theme-ad/issues

If you are sure, please run through this checklist for your pull request: 
-->

* [ ] Discuss carefully with author by email or issue.
* [ ] Check code standards: indent using 2 spaces, ESlint common rules, etc.
* [ ] Compile `/source/styles/index.scss` to `/source/css/index.css` if you need change style.
* [ ] Test it in chrome browser without no error in console.
* [ ] Write commit record in this format - `action: description`, such as `add: document url in README.md`.

#### What's the new behavior?

<!-- 
Please include at least one of the following: 

- A GIF / Some screenshots showing the new behavior in action.
- A description of how the new behavior works.

If you don't include one of these, there's a very good chance your pull request will take longer to review. Thank you!
-->

#### How does this change work?

<!-- 
If your change is non-trivial:
  1. include a short description of how the new logic works
  2. describe why you decided to solve it the way you did. 

This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess based on the code.
